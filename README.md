The Fedora Utility Tool is a simple tool to quickly navigate and troubleshoot our fedora models.
It presages its own demise since it is built to show data in Fedora 3 repositories (as opposed to the newer Fedora 4).
It is also tuned to our own idiosyncratic hydra models, but hey, since it is already a dead utility walking, who cares.
It is structured as a web app so the browser can do the heavy lifting of providing a GUI.
Maybe a curses interface would be nice, I'll look for a pull request.
